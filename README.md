# Employee SQL Data Analysis

This project involved performing data analysis on a PostgreSQL database containing employee information for a large company. The data spanned multiple decades and included information about employees, their salaries, departments, and department managers.

The analysis began with writing SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data from several tables, including `employees`, `salaries`, `departments`, `dept_emp`, and `dept_manager`. These queries helped extract insights such as employee details, the hiring date for employees hired in 1986, department managers, and the distribution of employees across departments.

### Key Tasks:
- Listing employee details such as employee number, name, sex, and salary.
- Identifying employees who were hired in the year 1986.
- Retrieving department managers and their corresponding departments.
- Listing employees working in the Sales and Development departments.
- Counting the frequency of employee last names across the organization.

This project demonstrated the power of relational databases in storing and retrieving complex datasets, and how SQL can be used to extract meaningful information from such data. All queries and the final analysis are organized in this repository.
